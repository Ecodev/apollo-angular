# Integrating with NativeScript

You can use Apollo with NativeScript exactly as you would with normal Angular application.

To introduce Apollo to your app, install `apollo-angular` and `apollo-angular-link-http` from npm
and use them in your app as outlined in the [setup](../basics/setup) article:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i apollo-angular apollo-angular-link-http
```

<Callout>
  **Note**: There are more packages to be installed, so check out the "initialization" article.
</Callout>

```ts
import { Apollo, ApolloModule } from 'apollo-angular';
import { HttpLink, HttpLinkModule } from 'apollo-angular-link-http';
import { NativeScriptHttpClientModule } from 'nativescript-angular/http-client';
import { NativeScriptModule } from 'nativescript-angular/nativescript.module';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NativeScriptModule,
    NativeScriptHttpClientModule, // this provides HttpClient
    ApolloModule,
    HttpLinkModule,
  ],
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(apollo: Apollo, httpLink: HttpLink) {
    // create Apollo
    apollo.create({
      link: httpLink.create({ uri }),
      // other options like cache
    });
  }
}
```

If you are new to using Apollo with Angular, you should probably read the [Angular guide](/).

## Examples

There are some Apollo examples written in NativeScript that you may wish to refer to:

- The ["Posts and Authors" example](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/apollo-angular-nativescript).
