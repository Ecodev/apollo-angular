# Migration Guide to v3

- File upload requires `extract-files` library

## File Upload

New `apollo-angular` no longer depends on `extract-files` library. To use file uploads, you need to
pass the `extractFiles` function (or create your own).

See [how to configure file upload](./data/network#file-Upload).
