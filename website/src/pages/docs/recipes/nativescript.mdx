# Integrating with NativeScript

You can use Apollo with NativeScript exactly as you would with normal Angular application.

To introduce Apollo to your app, install `apollo-angular` from npm and use them in your app as
outlined in the [setup](../get-started) article:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i apollo-angular
```

<Callout>
  **Note**: There are more packages to be installed, so check out the "initialization" article.
</Callout>

```ts filename="graphql.provider.ts"
import { Apollo, APOLLO_OPTIONS } from 'apollo-angular';
import { HttpLink } from 'apollo-angular/http';
import { NativeScriptHttpClientModule } from 'nativescript-angular/http-client';
import { NativeScriptModule } from 'nativescript-angular/nativescript.module';
import { importProvidersFrom, inject, Provider } from '@angular/core';
import { ApolloClientOptions, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client/core';

function apolloOptionsFactory(): ApolloClientOptions<any> {
  const httpLink = inject(HttpLink);

  return {
    link: httpLink.create({ uri: '/graphql' }),
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
    // other options ...
  };
}

export const graphqlProvider: Provider = [
  Apollo,
  importProvidersFrom(NativeScriptModule, NativeScriptHttpClientModule), // this provides HttpClient
  {
    provide: APOLLO_OPTIONS,
    useFactory: apolloOptionsFactory,
  },
];
```

If you are new to using Apollo with Angular, you should probably read the [Angular guide](/).

## Examples

There are some Apollo examples written in NativeScript that you may wish to refer to:
