Apollo Boost has been updated to use Apollo Client's integrated local state handling, which means it is no longer using ",Object(l.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"apollo-link-state"),". Behind the scenes, the Apollo Boost ",Object(l.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"clientState")," constructor parameter now feeds the necessary local state initialization directly into Apollo Client.")),Object(l.b)("li",{parentName:"ol"},Object(l.b)("p",{parentName:"li"},"Test thoroughly! \ud83d\ude42"))),Object(l.b)("h2",{id:"next-steps"},"Next steps"),Object(l.b)("p",null,"Managing your local data with Apollo Client can simplify your state management code since the Apollo cache is your single source of truth for all data in your application.
